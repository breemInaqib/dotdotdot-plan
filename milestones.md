# project milestones

The dotdotdot roadmap is divided into high‑level milestones that guide development from concept to launch. Each milestone builds on the previous one and provides clear deliverables.

## milestone 1: requirements & research
- conduct user research to understand target audience needs.
- define core features, functional and non‑functional requirements.
- evaluate existing cross‑platform frameworks and select technologies for the shared core and UI layer.

## milestone 2: architecture & prototypes
- design system architecture diagrams (client layers, backend microservices, data models).
- build proof‑of‑concept prototypes for the shared core and UI (e.g. simple note creation).
- set up repository structure, version control conventions, and initial CI/CD pipelines.

## milestone 3: core implementation
- implement the shared core library with essential business logic, offline storage, and synchronisation primitives.
- develop basic client applications (web, iOS, Android) leveraging the shared core.
- set up backend services (authentication, data storage) and expose API endpoints.

## milestone 4: feature expansion & integration
- add advanced features such as real‑time collaboration, search, tagging, and notifications.
- integrate third‑party services (e.g. cloud storage, identity providers) where appropriate.
- perform extensive testing (unit, integration, user acceptance) across platforms.

## milestone 5: optimisation & polish
- refine UI/UX across devices, ensuring accessibility and performance.
- optimise synchronisation algorithms and server scalability.
- implement analytics and monitoring to gather usage metrics.

## milestone 6: release & feedback
- prepare launch builds for app stores and web deployment.
- conduct beta testing with selected users and collect feedback.
- plan marketing, documentation, and support materials.

Roadmap items may evolve as the project progresses. Contributors should reference this file and open issues or discussions for any changes.
